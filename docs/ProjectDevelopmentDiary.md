My experiences developing the 611 WiFiZomatic Network

(what I did, how I felt about it)

working on getting a motor driver working with the Feather esp32.
compilation errors due to "undefined BUFFER_LENGTH"
One of those dependency issues that will send me down a rabbit hole…

frustration in other areas makes this feel especially… humiliating?

turns out there was some code from another library on github, included in this library, that needed to be written over the code that I was using. That's an unusual thing to have to do in code that's been stable for 2 years…
Makes me think about the people who write this code, then move on to the next thing as hardware changes underneath them…

thinking about the jankyness of hardware, wiring, solder, dependencies, bit rot… vs the myth of "it just works"

realizing that the documentation explaining the code you need to write to make the library work doesn't make any sense. Seems like someone just quit halfway through the job? 

But, relying on my own sense of how these things SHOULD workd, and stripping out the "we make it easy for you" parts, I get it working. Confidence boost!



Visit to Sensor Lab
Exploring different types of sensors motors, solenoids. Things that "percieve" and things that "move." The two parts of "response." The constraints of the hardware dialogue with the behaviours, hidden (to humans) and visible. 

installing open-source softare, running scripts that enable different types of open-source hardware to communicate with each other.

Scripts: downloaded instructions that run once to transform the computer to a new configuration, more optimal for my intentions.

Now that some basic network<->sound connection is established, I find myself rooting around in network protocols, looking at individual packets as they arrive and depart, trying to find interesting patterns. unpacking esoteric strings of protocol filters. The language of this network, on a more atomic(packets) or "chemical" (protocols) level.


Ah the mystery of code+hardware, when seemingly unrelated pieces of ocde interfere with each other. All you can do it cut pieces out until they work, then add them back one by one…

Wifi interferes with analog reading on half the chip, go figure…

now that most of the components have been working independantly, I'm starting to think about the personalities of these pieces. How can I breathe some life into their behaviours?

flappy toggles with some controllable randomness, to create a rustling with increasing intensity


Flappy relay issues; need to buy different things.…

now exploring the materiality at the intersection of small motors and sticks. IE, how strong are these things?


CyberPoop Lives!
- starting to make the network parts talk, feels like progress…

the calm that comse from working with materials, inbetween bouts of failure and debugging…
flow.

Each motor needs custom settings for its unique variability. The stopSpeed value (the equilibrium point) is always a little bit different, to make that motor actually stop.

these materials force me to create some really idiosyncratic movements and interactions.

adding sounds helps the whole vibe to be more playful, and enhances the oddness of it all...

practicing things to say:
- an assemblage of dysfunctional plant cyborgs
- Anxious objects reflecting our own climate anxiety
- attempting to thrive in the post-anthropocene through pure charm
- retaining a genetic memory of cooperation, cobbling together a configuration through recycled technologies to replace the lost michorrizal network

- these interactions are not for us, though we can participate in them, through fertilization and watering, and providing prompts for their response
- the mystery and delight of nature, reimagined through this cast of interacting characters.

- the sounds of nature echo through the forest, providing us clues as to the energies and signals passing through the wifizomatic network

- The cyberplants can
    - warn each other of danger
    - share water
    - share fertilization
- But they each have motivations all their own

- an interactive environment… tension btw immersion and alienation? 

- these non-humans are attempting to evolve at a fast enough pace to keep up with rapid environmental changes. We can forgive them if not all of their adaptations meet the challenges of the post-anthropocene...
